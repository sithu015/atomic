//! Scheduled-task framework for atomic-core.
//!
//! This module defines a minimal scheduling primitive that any transport
//! (atomic-server, Tauri sidecar, etc.) can drive from its own runtime. The
//! registry lives here so task implementations ship with core, while the
//! ticking loop itself is owned by the caller.
//!
//! Tasks own their work and their due-ness predicate; the [`runner`] module
//! owns the execution lifecycle — `task_runs` ledger claim, retry/backoff,
//! the `last_run` fast-path advance, and event emission. See
//! [`runner::run_task`] for the claim-and-record contract.
