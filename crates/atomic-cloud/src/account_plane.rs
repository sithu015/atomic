//! The account plane: public (non-tenant) routes served on the **app host**
//! (plan: "Subdomain rules" — `app.atomic.cloud` for the marketing site /
//! signup; "Provisioning lifecycle" → "Signup" steps 1–2).
//!
//! # The host split
//!
//! The cloud composition serves two disjoint planes, split on the request
//! `Host`:
//!
//! - **Tenant subdomains** (`<slug>.<base>`) — atomic-server's API under
//!   [`CloudAuth`](crate::auth::CloudAuth). Unchanged by this module.
//! - **The app host** — the bare base domain (`atomic.cloud`) *and*
//!   `app.<base>` (`app.atomic.cloud`); both are accepted so the apex and
//!   the canonical `app.` name behave identically and a bare-domain visitor
//!   isn't met with a 404 (whichever one marketing doesn't use redirects to
//!   the other at the DNS/CDN layer, not here). No CloudAuth, no tenant
//!   state — these routes serve people who don't have an account yet.
//!
//! Both directions fail closed, each by its own mechanism:
//!
//! - Account-plane routes carry a [`Guard`] that matches only the app host,
//!   so on a tenant subdomain they don't exist (404 before any handler).
//! - Tenant routes need no guard: `CloudAuth` already 404s the bare base
//!   domain (no subdomain label to extract — see `subdomain_from_host` in
//!   `auth.rs`) and `app` is on the static blocklist
//!   ([`crate::reserved_subdomains`]) so its account lookup can never
//!   resolve. The e2e suite pins both directions against the live
//!   composition.
//!
//! # Routes
//!
//! - `POST /signup/request-link` `{email, subdomain}` — validate, issue a
//!   signup magic link, email it. Bad email/slug are honest 400s (they're
//!   client-fixable and leak nothing the public DNS namespace doesn't
//!   already leak); everything after validation — including email-send
//!   failure — answers the same neutral 200, because differential responses
//!   on the email axis are exactly the enumeration oracle the login route
//!   must not have, and the two routes should behave identically. One
//!   deliberate carve-out in the availability check: a subdomain whose only
//!   claim is a `'provisioning'` account for the *same* (lowercased) email
//!   is **not** "taken" — that claim is the requester's own crashed signup,
//!   and a fresh link is exactly how they resume it (`provision_account` is
//!   idempotent for the same email + subdomain).
//! - `POST /login/request-link` `{email}` — if an active account matches,
//!   email a login link. The response is byte-identical whether or not the
//!   account exists (no email enumeration; e2e-pinned) — **and arrives in
//!   uniform time**: both branches return right after the same synchronous
//!   work (the rate-limit charges plus one indexed account lookup). The
//!   issue+send on the exists branch is `tokio::spawn`ed fire-and-forget,
//!   because awaiting it (a DB insert plus an outbound Mailgun POST,
//!   hundreds of ms) would make response latency the very enumeration
//!   oracle the identical bodies exist to close. Spawn-side failures are
//!   logged, never reflected in the response — which is already the policy
//!   for send failures on both routes. The residual signal is the lookup
//!   itself: one indexed SELECT on both branches, far below network jitter.
//! - `GET /signup/complete?token=…` — consume the signup link and provision
//!   the account synchronously (plan: "Signup" steps 3–12, minus the
//!   deferred 7–8; step 9's managed key runs per the configured
//!   [`ManagedKeys`] mode), then establish a session and 302 to the new
//!   tenant. See "Completion semantics" below.
//! - `GET /login/complete?token=…` — consume the login link, find the
//!   active account by the link's email, establish a session, 302 to the
//!   account's subdomain.
//!
//! # Completion semantics
//!
//! The completion routes handle a **single-use credential**, so the order
//! of refusals is load-bearing. Signup completion admits in four steps —
//! shape, peek, permit, consume — each refusing as early (and as cheaply)
//! as the refusal can be made sound:
//!
//! - **Syntactic shape first** ([`magic_link_token_shape_ok`]): a token
//!   that can't possibly be real is refused before any database work.
//! - **Then a read-only eligibility peek** ([`peek_magic_link`]): a dead
//!   token (unknown, expired, spent, wrong purpose) is refused before the
//!   provision permit is touched. Together these keep junk requests from
//!   starving the semaphore — only plausibly-live tokens ever contend for a
//!   permit. The handler never awaits anything unbounded while
//!   unauthenticated; the peek is one indexed SELECT.
//! - **Capacity is checked before the token is consumed.** Synchronous
//!   provisioning is capped by a process-wide semaphore
//!   ([`AccountPlaneConfig::max_concurrent_provisions`]; plan: 4–8). A
//!   saturated process answers a structured 503 + `Retry-After` *without*
//!   touching the link — consume-then-refuse would burn the user's only
//!   credential on a condition that retrying cures. `try_acquire`, never
//!   wait.
//! - **Consumption is atomic and purpose-pinned** (one UPDATE; see
//!   [`crate::magic_links::consume_magic_link`]). Expired, reused,
//!   wrong-purpose, and unknown tokens are all the same honest
//!   `invalid_link` 400 — distinguishing WHY would hand out an oracle over
//!   the magic-link table. A double click is therefore one provision and
//!   one clean 400, never two provisions.
//! - **`SubdomainTaken` at consume time is a 409** telling the user to
//!   restart signup with a different name. The consumed token stays spent —
//!   un-consuming would reopen the replay window, and a fresh request-link
//!   is cheap and rate-limited, so the honest trade-off is "this click is
//!   spent, ask again".
//! - **A provision failure after consumption** leaves the accounts row in
//!   `status='provisioning'`; the response is a structured 500 advising
//!   retry-later. The safety-net reaper ([`crate::reaper`]) is what retries
//!   or rolls back such rows — and the request-link route's
//!   same-email carve-out (above) is what lets the user resume sooner by
//!   simply asking for a fresh link.
//!
//! On success the route creates a web session ([`crate::tokens`]) and sets
//! the [`SESSION_COOKIE`](crate::auth::SESSION_COOKIE) with
//! `Domain=.<base>; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=<session TTL>`
//! (plan: "Web sessions" — the leading dot makes one session work across
//! every subdomain; the account-scoped verification in `CloudAuth` is what
//! keeps that from crossing tenants). `Secure` is on by default and must
//! stay on in production. The one exception is a local/headless dev box
//! served over plain HTTP on a non-`localhost` host (e.g. reached over
//! Tailscale): browsers only exempt `localhost`/`*.localhost` from the
//! `Secure`-requires-HTTPS rule, so on such a host a `Secure` cookie is
//! silently dropped and the dashboard can never authenticate. The
//! [`AccountPlaneConfig::cookie_secure`] flag (CLI:
//! `--dangerously-insecure-cookies`, default off) drops `Secure` for exactly
//! that case and warns loudly at boot; never use it in production.
//! The redirect targets `<slug>.<base>` with the scheme/port of
//! [`AccountPlaneConfig::app_public_url`] — production defaults yield
//! `https://<slug>.<base>/`; dev setups keep their explicit port.
//!
//! # Anti-abuse limits (plan: "Quotas" table)
//!
//! - Request-link routes (signup + login combined): 5 per client IP per
//!   hour. The plan's table lists only "signup attempts per IP"; covering
//!   login with the same shared bucket is this implementation's choice —
//!   login request-link is the same probe surface (an enumerating client
//!   doesn't care which route answers), so it gets the same per-IP cost,
//!   and a shared bucket means switching routes doesn't mint fresh
//!   allowance. See [`crate::rate_limit`].
//! - Magic-link requests (signup + login combined): 3 per email per hour.
//!
//! Per-pod in-memory sliding windows ([`crate::rate_limit`]); refusals are
//! 429 with `Retry-After`. On both routes the IP limit is charged *before
//! everything else* — before validation (a validation-failing request is
//! still an attempt) and before any lookup. The email limit runs after
//! validation, keyed on the (lowercased) email, and is always charged
//! before the account lookup so the limiter's behavior cannot become an
//! enumeration side channel either.
//!
//! # Response headers
//!
//! Every account-plane response carries `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
//! (a `DefaultHeaders` wrap on both scopes). Completion URLs carry live
//! single-use credentials in their query string; without the policy, the
//! post-completion redirect (and any error page a browser renders) could
//! leak the token to the next origin via the `Referer` header.
//!
//! # Client IP derivation
//!
//! By default the connection's peer address is the client IP. That is
//! spoof-proof but wrong behind a reverse proxy: every request appears to
//! come from the proxy, so all clients share one bucket and a single abuser
//! exhausts signups for everyone. `trust_proxy_header` flips to reading
//! `X-Forwarded-For` — the **rightmost** entry, the one appended by the
//! trusted proxy itself; earlier entries are client-controlled. The
//! trade-off cuts both ways and is the operator's call: enabling the flag
//! without a header-sanitizing proxy in front lets clients spoof arbitrary
//! IPs and sidestep the per-IP limit entirely; leaving it off behind a
//! proxy collapses the limit to per-proxy granularity.
