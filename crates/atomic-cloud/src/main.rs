//! Atomic Cloud — binary entry point.
//!
//! Subcommands:
//!
//! - `serve` — run the composed multi-tenant server (see [`atomic_cloud::server`]),
//!   applying pending control-plane migrations on boot.
//! - `migrate` — apply pending control-plane migrations and exit.
//! - `account create` / `account delete` — operator-side provisioning, the
//!   manual path until the signup slice lands the HTTP flow.
//! - `token create` — mint a control-plane API token for an account.
//!
//! Every command takes `--control-url` (or `ATOMIC_CLOUD_CONTROL_URL`) before
//! the subcommand and runs migrations first, so any command works against a
//! fresh cluster.
//!
//! # Master key
//!
//! `serve` additionally requires the provider-credential master key (env
//! var named by `--master-key-env`, default `ATOMIC_CLOUD_MASTER_KEY`) and
//! refuses to boot without a valid one — provider features are integral to
//! serving (managed keys are provisioned at signup; BYOK settings routes
//! decrypt stored keys), so a missing/malformed key is a deployment error
//! best surfaced at boot, not on the first signup. The other subcommands
//! (`migrate`, `account`, `token`) deliberately never load the vault — or
//! the OpenRouter provisioning key — so operator tooling stays runnable
//! from hosts that hold neither production secret. The trade-off is that
//! `account create` provisions keyless accounts and `account delete` cannot
//! delete a managed runtime key (it logs the residue loudly with the
//! `external_key_id`; the master OpenRouter account's key listing is the
//! cleanup path). The HTTP routes, which run inside `serve`, do both
//! properly — prefer them.
