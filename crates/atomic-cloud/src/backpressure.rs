//! Provider backpressure: the per-tenant circuit breaker and the
//! interactive `out_of_ai_credits` surface (plan: "Worker fairness & job
//! queue" → "Provider rate-limit handling"; "Provider management" →
//! "Managed key lifecycle" / "Blocked states").
//!
//! # Two layers
//!
//! **Layer 1 — local backoff** lives with the ledgers, not here: a
//! rate-limited `task_runs` execution gets its `next_attempt_at` pushed out
//! by the ledger's own exponential backoff (`scheduler::ledger::fail`), and
//! a rate-limited pipeline job is re-enqueued by the dispatcher's executor
//! with `not_before` honoring the provider's `Retry-After` hint (see
//! [`crate::dispatcher::CoreExecutor`]). This module is **layer 2**: when
//! one tenant's provider keeps rate-limiting, per-row backoff alone would
//! keep burning dispatch capacity (and the provider's goodwill) on a tenant
//! that needs a real pause.
//!
//! # The breaker state machine
//!
//! - **Detection is in-memory, per pod**: a sliding window of
//!   rate-limit-classified failures per tenant. Three within 60 seconds
//!   trips the breaker. Per-pod detection is deliberate — sharing failure
//!   counts across pods would buy a slightly earlier trip at the cost of a
//!   control-plane write per failure; a noisy tenant trips every pod's
//!   window within seconds anyway. The map self-bounds: a trip and a
//!   provider-class success both drop the tenant's window, and every
//!   failure note also sweeps out windows whose newest entry has aged past
//!   the detection horizon, so tenants that fail a couple of times and go
//!   quiet don't accumulate.
//! - **Only provider-touching work feeds detection.** Maintenance tasks
//!   and non-inline feed polls never call the provider, so their successes
//!   say nothing about the provider's health — they must neither reset the
//!   streak nor clear the window (or interleaved housekeeping would keep a
//!   chronically rate-limited tenant from ever tripping, and keep a
//!   tripped one from ever escalating). The dispatcher's executor owns
//!   that gating (see `crate::dispatcher`): `record_healthy` is called
//!   only for provider-class executions that genuinely succeeded.
//! - **The pause itself is control plane**, so every pod honors it:
//!   `accounts.provider_paused_until` (+ `provider_pause_kind`,
//!   `provider_pause_streak`; migration 007). The dispatcher skips paused
//!   tenants wholesale — their ledger work *sits*, it never fails.
//! - **Cooldown doubles per consecutive trip** (60s, 120s, …, capped at
//!   1h), tracked by `provider_pause_streak`. A healthy run resets the
//!   streak ([`ProviderBreaker::record_healthy`]); so does any provider
//!   mutation (BYOK save / activate / models write — rotation step 6, in
//!   [`crate::provider_credentials`]).
//! - **Credit exhaustion (402)** pauses immediately with
//!   `kind = 'credits'`, until the allowance's reset when known, else a
//!   recheck horizon (1h). It does not touch the streak — it isn't a
//!   rate-limit escalation, it's a billing wall that lifts on reset,
//!   upgrade, or key rotation.
//! - **Credential rejection (401/403)** — a BYOK key expired, revoked, or
//!   mis-scoped — pauses immediately with `kind = 'provider'` (the plan's
//!   "BYOK key expired" breaker case): no retry succeeds until the user
//!   fixes the key, so background dispatch holds until a provider mutation
//!   clears the pause (or the recheck horizon re-probes, in case the 401
//!   was the provider's own hiccup). Like credits, it never touches the
//!   rate-limit streak; unlike credits, interactive routes keep their
//!   current behavior — the user gets the provider's real auth error,
//!   which is the actionable one.
//!
//! # The rate-limit / credits asymmetry
//!
//! A **rate-limit** pause stops *background dispatch only*. Interactive
//! traffic (chat, an explicit wiki generate) still goes to the provider —
//! it has its own provider-side limiting, and a user staring at a chat box
//! deserves the provider's real answer, not a synthetic one. The breaker
//! protects the *background* budget.
//!
//! A **credits** pause additionally turns the AI-interactive routes into a
//! structured 402 ([`out_of_credits_guard`]): the provider would refuse
//! anyway, and "out of AI credits, resets at X" is a better answer than a
//! provider error string. Atom CRUD — and everything else non-AI — stays
//! fully functional; the ledger holds the background work for when the
//! allowance returns.
//!
//! One last-writer-wins residue: the two pause kinds share one column pair,
//! so a rate-limit trip while a credits pause is in force overwrites the
//! kind, briefly re-opening the interactive routes. The next interactive or
//! dispatched call hits the provider's 402 and re-pauses as credits —
//! self-healing, and not worth a second column pair.
