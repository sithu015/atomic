//! Plan-tier resource enforcement on the data plane (plan: "Observability,
//! quotas, billing" → "Quotas" → "Enforcement points").
//!
//! Cloud cannot touch atomic-server's route handlers (the one-way dependency
//! rule), so resource limits are enforced the way slice 2 marked dispatch
//! hints and slice 4 capped chat streams: a cloud middleware on `api_scope`
//! that path-matches the relevant mutating routes and checks the plan's
//! limit **before** delegating, returning the structured error itself. The
//! handler is never reached on a quota hit, so no atom is created and no
//! ledger work is enqueued.
//!
//! # What's enforced, and how the count is read
//!
//! | Route                                   | Limit       | Count source                        |
//! |-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `POST /api/atoms`                       | `atom_limit`| account-wide live atom sum          |
//! | `POST /api/atoms/bulk`                  | `atom_limit`| account-wide sum + the request batch|
//! | `POST /api/ingest/url`                  | `atom_limit`| account-wide sum + 1                |
//! | `POST /api/ingest/urls`                 | `atom_limit`| account-wide sum + the request batch|
//! | `POST /api/import/obsidian`             | `atom_limit`| account-wide sum + 1 (per-note delta)|
//! | `POST /api/databases`                   | `kb_limit`  | `DatabaseManager::list_databases()` |
//!
//! URL ingestion and Obsidian import create atoms exactly like the
//! `/api/atoms` routes, so they count against `atom_limit` too — an account at
//! its ceiling can't slip past the gate by ingesting or importing instead of
//! creating (the plan's enforcement table lists "Atom create" generically; all
//! these surfaces grow the atom count).
//!
//! The atom count is **account-wide**: it sums `count_atoms()` across every
//! knowledge base in the tenant, not just the one a request targets, because
//! the limit is an account ceiling (plan). Counting only the targeted KB would
//! let a tenant on a finite-atom plan with `kb_limit > 1` evade the ceiling by
//! spreading atoms across KBs. This matches
//! [`account_over_plan_limits`]' semantics; the KB list is small, so it stays
//! cheap. The KB count is `DatabaseManager::list_databases()` length.
//!
//! Both counts are read **live** from the tenant database at enforcement
//! time — cheap, single-statement per KB, strongly consistent. There is no
//! stored atom/KB counter to drift (the `quota_usage` table is for metrics
//! that can't be counted cheaply live; see [`crate::plans`]). A `NULL` limit
//! means unlimited and the guard passes the request straight through —
//! the count is never even read.
//!
//! # Cost bound on the create hot path
//!
//! The atom gate adds tenant-database round-trips before the handler runs
//! (one `count_atoms()` per knowledge base). These ride the tenant pool's
//! connection acquire, which is bounded by the pool's `acquire_timeout`
//! (10s; see [`crate::account_cache`] / the cluster pool config) — there is
//! no statement-level timeout on the count itself, as that would require an
//! atomic-core change (the one-way dependency rule forbids teaching core
//! about cloud), and the count is a trivially-indexed aggregate. The acquire
//! timeout is the operative upper bound on how long the gate can delay a
//! create before failing it with an operational error.
//!
//! # The live-count gate is a soft ceiling, not a reservation
//!
//! The check reads the live count and admits if `current + delta <= limit`
//! with no row lock or pre-reservation — a deliberate trade (deviation log
//! below) for a cheap, drift-free counter over a contended `quota_usage`
//! UPSERT. The residual is a TOCTOU: two concurrent creates at
//! `current = limit - 1` can both observe the pre-write count and both admit,
//! landing the tenant one over the ceiling. This is acceptable for a soft
//! resource limit (the overshoot is bounded by concurrency, self-heals as
//! the count is re-read on the next write, and never affects money or
//! managed-key credits — those ride the AI ledger, not this gate). If a hard
//! cap is ever required, this is the seam to swap in a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
//! reservation against a stored counter.
//!
//! # The bulk batch delta
//!
//! A bulk create can push the tenant over the limit with a single request,
//! so the guard accounts for the batch: it admits only if
//! `current + batch_size <= limit`. Reading `batch_size` means reading the
//! request body in the middleware, which would consume the payload the
//! handler needs — so the guard buffers the body, counts the array's
//! elements, and **re-injects** the exact bytes before delegating
//! ([`peek_and_replay_json_array_len`]). The single-atom route needs no body
//! read (its delta is always 1).
//!
//! # Quota-exceeded response shape
//!
//! Exactly the plan's contract:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "error": "quota_exceeded",
//!   "metric": "atoms",
//!   "current": 100,
//!   "limit": 100,
//!   "resets_at": null,
//!   "upgrade_url": "https://app.<base>/account/billing" }
//! ```
//!
//! `resets_at` is `null` for resource limits — they don't reset on a clock,
//! they clear when the user deletes data or upgrades (plan: "Downgrade …
//! over-limit usage retained but writes blocked until under"). `upgrade_url`
//! is derived from the request host (`<sub>.<base>` → `https://app.<base>/account/billing`),
//! the same derivation the out-of-credits guard uses.
