//! Per-tenant schema-migration tracking and the boot-time fleet runner
//! (plan: "Provisioning lifecycle" → "Schema migration on deploy", steps
//! 1-5 + "Stragglers" + "Multi-pod boot").
//!
//! One tenant = one Postgres database, all running atomic-core's tenant
//! migrations — so a binary upgrade is a *fleet* migration: every tenant
//! database must be brought to the new binary's compiled schema target.
//! Migration 008 adds the tracking columns to `account_databases`; this
//! module holds the typed query surface over them plus the
//! [`FleetMigrator`] that drives them at boot, shared by three consumers:
//!
//! - **The boot-time fleet runner** ([`FleetMigrator`]) enumerates lagging
//!   tenants ([`list_unmigrated`]), fans out under a concurrency cap, runs
//!   `storage.initialize()` per tenant, and records each outcome
//!   ([`record_migration_success`] / [`record_migration_failure`]). The
//!   deploy gate around it (readiness, the failure-rate policy, the
//!   `deploy_runs` history) lives in [`crate::deploy`].
//! - **The reaper's lagging-migrations arm** ([`crate::reaper`], arm 4)
//!   owns *every* lagging row whose backoff horizon (if any) has passed
//!   ([`list_retryable_failures`]) and retries each through the same
//!   per-tenant step and record functions ([`migrate_tenant`]). Ownership
//!   is deliberately keyed on lagging-ness, not on recorded failure state:
//!   the boot runner enumerates exactly once per pod lifetime, so any row
//!   that becomes (or stays) lagging *after* that enumeration — an
//!   old-binary signup completing mid-rolling-deploy, a lost success or
//!   failure recording, a panicked migration task — would otherwise have
//!   no owner and 503 forever. The reaper is the standing backstop.
//! - **CloudAuth's straggler gate** reads `last_migrated_version` on its
//!   per-request account lookup and returns the structured 503
//!   `account_upgrading` while a tenant lags [`tenant_schema_target`] (see
//!   `crate::auth`).
//!
//! [`provision_account`](crate::provision::provision_account) stamps the
//! compiled target when it writes the `account_databases` row (the tenant
//! was fully migrated two steps earlier), so fresh tenants are never
//! stragglers.
//!
//! # Multi-pod boot (plan: "Multi-pod boot")
//!
//! Every pod boots a [`FleetMigrator`] and races over the same fleet — no
//! coordination, no leader election. **The per-database advisory lock
//! inside atomic-core's migration runner (`storage.initialize()`) is the
//! multi-pod story**: two pods migrating the same tenant serialize on that
//! lock, the loser re-reads `schema_version` under it and applies nothing,
//! and both record the same success (monotonically — see
//! [`record_migration_success`]). Racing is safe, merely wasteful; the plan
//! defers a single-pod-claims-the-run optimization until deploy times hurt.
