//! The dunning state machine and billing serving-state transitions (plan:
//! "Billing" → "Plan transitions"; Decisions log 2026-05-25 "Never
//! auto-delete data for payment failure. Read-only after 3 days past_due,
//! suspended after 14 days, data retained").
//!
//! `accounts.billing_state` is the serving restriction a payment problem
//! imposes; it is **orthogonal** to `accounts.status` (CloudAuth's
//! provisioning/active gate). A delinquent account stays `status='active'`.
//! The four states and what each permits on the data plane:
//!
//! | State       | Reads | Writes | Login | Notes                          |
//! |-------------|-------|--------|-------|--------------------------------|
//! | `active`    | ✓     | ✓      | ✓     | Normal.                        |
//! | `past_due`  | ✓     | ✓      | ✓     | Grace; full access.            |
//! | `read_only` | ✓     | ✗      | ✓     | 3 days past_due; writes 402.   |
//! | `suspended` | ✗     | ✗      | ✗     | 14 days past_due; data kept.   |
//!
//! Transitions are driven from two places:
//!
//! - **Webhooks** ([`apply_subscription_event`], [`apply_payment_outcome`]):
//!   a failed payment moves `active → past_due` and stamps `past_due_since`;
//!   a succeeded payment (or a checkout/upgrade) clears back to `active`; a
//!   deleted subscription drops the plan to `free` (keeping any over-limit
//!   data, writes blocked until under — enforced by the quota guard, not
//!   here).
//! - **Time** ([`advance_dunning`]): a reaper-style sweep that reads
//!   `past_due_since` and advances `past_due → read_only` at 3 days and
//!   `read_only → suspended` at 14 days. It takes an explicit `now` so the
//!   thresholds are testable by manufacturing a past `past_due_since` via
//!   SQL — no real waits.
