//! Cloud-owned routes on the **tenant plane** (per-account subdomains).
//!
//! Most of the tenant plane *is* atomic-server's `api_scope()` under
//! [`CloudAuth`](crate::auth::CloudAuth); this module holds the routes that
//! have no self-hosted counterpart because they act on the **account** —
//! control-plane state — rather than on knowledge-base data. One route so
//! far:
//!
//! # `DELETE /api/account` (plan: "Provisioning lifecycle" → "Account deletion")
//!
//! Hard-deletes the authenticated account. It lives on the tenant subdomain
//! — deletion is an action on *this account* — and CloudAuth's host routing
//! is what binds the request to it: the route is unreachable from the app
//! host (no subdomain label → CloudAuth 404s before any handler) and
//! unreachable for other tenants (their credentials don't verify here — the
//! cross-tenant chokepoint). The e2e suite pins both directions anyway.
//!
//! Two refusals run before anything is touched, in order:
//!
//! - **Scope** — only account-scope credentials may destroy the account:
//!   account-scope tokens and web sessions (sessions always carry account
//!   scope; see [`crate::auth`]). Database- and MCP-scoped tokens get 403 —
//!   a KB-pinned integration must never be able to take the whole account
//!   down with it.
//! - **Confirmation** — the body must be `{"confirm": "<subdomain>"}`
//!   naming the account's own subdomain, so a stray DELETE (wrong host in a
//!   script, the shared base-domain cookie riding along) can't fire. A
//!   missing, malformed, or mismatched body is a 400.
//!
//! Then the sequence: [`delete_account`] → [`AccountCache::evict`] → the
//! WebSocket severing falls out of the eviction (below). A repeat DELETE
//! after success never reaches the handler: the accounts row is gone, so
//! CloudAuth answers 404 at step 2.
//!
//! # Cancellation-proofing: the work runs in a spawned task
//!
//! actix drops a handler's future the moment the client disconnects. The
//! deletion sequence destroys the account's credentials *first* (token
//! revocation, session deletion — deliberately, to close the
//! still-authenticated crash window) and then does multi-second work
//! (terminating backends, dropping the tenant database). A future dropped
//! between those would strand a zombie: `status = 'active'`, credentials
//! revoked, tenant database possibly gone — an account its owner can no
//! longer drive to completion with the credential they just used. So the
//! handler spawns the delete + evict sequence as a detached task
//! (`actix_web::rt::spawn` onto the worker's LocalSet) and awaits its
//! `JoinHandle`: a disconnect cancels only the *await*, while the spawned
//! task runs to completion regardless. Only a process death can interrupt
//! the sequence now — and that residue is exactly what the reaper's
//! interrupted-deletion arm detects (an active account with no
//! `account_databases` row) and completes.
//!
//! # Ordering: delete first, evict second
//!
//! The plan's deletion sequence lists cache eviction (step 5) before the
//! database drop (step 7); in-process the safe order is the reverse, and
//! [`delete_account`] makes it equivalent:
//!
//! - Evict-then-delete leaves a window where a concurrent authenticated
//!   request (tokens still verify until `delete_account`'s first step)
//!   re-warms the cache mid-drop — resurrecting a pool, and a fresh event
//!   channel nobody will ever sever, for an account that's about to be gone.
//! - Delete-then-evict closes that window: once `delete_account` returns,
//!   the accounts row is gone (CloudAuth 404s) and the `account_databases`
//!   rows are gone (a cache rebuild fails typed), so the eviction is final.
//!   The pooled connections an un-evicted entry held during the drop are
//!   handled inside `delete_account` — `pg_terminate_backend` plus
//!   `DROP DATABASE … WITH (FORCE)`.
//!
//! # WebSocket severing
//!
//! Eviction drops the cache entry, and with it the entry's broadcast
//! `Sender`. When the last remaining clone goes — typically this DELETE
//! request's own `RequestEventChannel` extension, dropped with the response
//! — every `/ws` session's `Receiver` yields `RecvError::Closed`;
//! `ws::start_event_session`'s forwarding loop breaks on exactly that,
//! drops its `actix_ws::Session`, and the connection terminates (the
//! session channel closing ends the response's streaming body). No
//! cloud-side reaping of sessions is needed. Deletion deliberately bypasses
//! the live-receiver eviction pinning — pinning protects *idle* entries
//! from TTL eviction; it must never protect a deleted account's resources
//! ([`AccountCache::evict`] is unconditional by contract, and the e2e suite
//! pins the combination).
//!
