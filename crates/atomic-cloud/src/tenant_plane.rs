//! Cloud-owned routes on the **tenant plane** (per-account subdomains).
//!
//! Most of the tenant plane *is* atomic-server's `api_scope()` under
//! [`CloudAuth`](crate::auth::CloudAuth); this module holds the routes that
//! have no self-hosted counterpart because they act on the **account** —
//! control-plane state — rather than on knowledge-base data. Two route
//! families: account deletion, and the provider settings API.
//!
//! Every route here shares the same authorization posture: CloudAuth's host
//! routing binds the request to the subdomain's account (unreachable from
//! the app host; cross-tenant credentials fail the chokepoint), and only
//! **account-scope** credentials may act — database- and MCP-scoped tokens
//! get 403, because a KB-pinned integration must neither destroy the
//! account nor read/rotate its provider credentials.
//!
//! # The provider settings API (plan: "Provider management")
//!
//! Four routes implementing "BYOK entry & validation", "Live rotation",
//! "Model curation", and "Audit / visibility":
//!
//! - **`GET /api/account/provider`** — status only. Provider, origin,
//!   configured flag, model config, validation/usage timestamps, and (for
//!   managed keys) best-effort allowance usage from the provisioning API.
//!   **No key material, ever** — not even a prefix; the stored key is never
//!   displayed and rotation means replacing it.
//! - **`PUT /api/account/provider`** — BYOK save. The submitted
//!   `model_config` is vocabulary-checked
//!   ([`validate_byok_model_config`]) — the column is plaintext and echoed
//!   by status, so unknown keys (an `api_key` nested where it doesn't
//!   belong) are rejected, never stored. The candidate config's effective
//!   embedding dimension must equal the platform pin
//!   ([`PINNED_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`]) — no cloud mechanism can recreate a
//!   tenant's vector index at another width, so a differing dimension is a
//!   structured 400 (`embedding_dimension_unsupported`), not a warning.
//!   Then the key is **validated against the provider before anything is
//!   stored** (OpenRouter: `GET {base}/auth/key`; OpenAI-compatible: a
//!   minimal embedding call through the same provider machinery the
//!   pipeline uses). Validation failure → 400 carrying the provider's
//!   error verbatim (scrubbed of the submitted key, should a hostile
//!   endpoint echo it — scrubbed *before* truncation, so a key cut by the
//!   length bound can't survive as a fragment) and nothing stored. Success
//!   → encrypt + UPSERT the `origin='user'` row, flip the active pointer,
//!   live-rotate.
//! - **`POST /api/account/provider/activate`** — the column flip between
//!   stored rows (managed ↔ BYOK, both directions). 404s when the target
//!   row doesn't exist; a missing managed row is **not** re-provisioned
//!   here — managed keys are minted at signup only.
//! - **`PUT /api/account/provider/models`** — model selection on the active
//!   row. Managed rows are curation-checked ([`crate::curated_models`]) and
//!   merged over the stored config so platform-seeded keys survive; BYOK
//!   rows choose freely within the vocabulary and replace wholesale. The
//!   same dimension pin applies — a write whose effective embedding
//!   dimension differs from the platform's is rejected before anything is
//!   stored. A same-dimension embedding-model change returns a loud
//!   `reembed_warning` — every stored vector is invalidated by it.
//!
//! **Live rotation** (plan steps 1-6): after any successful write the fresh
//! [`ProviderConfig`] is applied to the account's cached entry via
//! [`AccountCache::update_provider_config`] — an in-place swap, not an
//! eviction, so in-flight operations finish on the config they started with
//! and open WebSockets are untouched. Step 6 — clearing the circuit
//! breaker's pause (`accounts.provider_paused_until` + kind + streak) — is
//! not handled here at all: it rides the same statement/transaction as the
//! credential write's `provider_generation` bump (see
//! `crate::provider_credentials`), so a rotation and its fresh chance are
//! atomic by construction. The three mutating routes are serialized per
//! account ([`AccountLocks`]) so the stored and live configs cannot diverge
//! under concurrent writes.
//!
//! # `DELETE /api/account` (plan: "Provisioning lifecycle" → "Account deletion")
//!
//! Hard-deletes the authenticated account. It lives on the tenant subdomain
//! — deletion is an action on *this account* — and CloudAuth's host routing
//! is what binds the request to it: the route is unreachable from the app
//! host (no subdomain label → CloudAuth 404s before any handler) and
//! unreachable for other tenants (their credentials don't verify here — the
//! cross-tenant chokepoint). The e2e suite pins both directions anyway.
//!
//! Two refusals run before anything is touched, in order:
//!
//! - **Scope** — only account-scope credentials may destroy the account:
//!   account-scope tokens and web sessions (sessions always carry account
//!   scope; see [`crate::auth`]). Database- and MCP-scoped tokens get 403 —
//!   a KB-pinned integration must never be able to take the whole account
//!   down with it.
//! - **Confirmation** — the body must be `{"confirm": "<subdomain>"}`
//!   naming the account's own subdomain, so a stray DELETE (wrong host in a
//!   script, the shared base-domain cookie riding along) can't fire. A
//!   missing, malformed, or mismatched body is a 400.
//!
//! Then the sequence: [`delete_account`] → [`AccountCache::evict`] → the
//! WebSocket severing falls out of the eviction (below). A repeat DELETE
//! after success never reaches the handler: the accounts row is gone, so
//! CloudAuth answers 404 at step 2.
//!
//! # Cancellation-proofing: the work runs in a spawned task
//!
//! actix drops a handler's future the moment the client disconnects. The
//! deletion sequence destroys the account's credentials *first* (token
//! revocation, session deletion — deliberately, to close the
//! still-authenticated crash window) and then does multi-second work
//! (terminating backends, dropping the tenant database). A future dropped
//! between those would strand a zombie: `status = 'active'`, credentials
//! revoked, tenant database possibly gone — an account its owner can no
//! longer drive to completion with the credential they just used. So the
//! handler spawns the delete + evict sequence as a detached task
//! (`actix_web::rt::spawn` onto the worker's LocalSet) and awaits its
//! `JoinHandle`: a disconnect cancels only the *await*, while the spawned
//! task runs to completion regardless. Only a process death can interrupt
//! the sequence now — and that residue is exactly what the reaper's
//! interrupted-deletion arm detects (an active account with no
//! `account_databases` row) and completes.
//!
//! # Ordering: delete first, evict second
//!
//! The plan's deletion sequence lists cache eviction (step 5) before the
//! database drop (step 7); in-process the safe order is the reverse, and
//! [`delete_account`] makes it equivalent:
//!
//! - Evict-then-delete leaves a window where a concurrent authenticated
//!   request (tokens still verify until `delete_account`'s first step)
//!   re-warms the cache mid-drop — resurrecting a pool, and a fresh event
//!   channel nobody will ever sever, for an account that's about to be gone.
//! - Delete-then-evict closes that window: once `delete_account` returns,
//!   the accounts row is gone (CloudAuth 404s) and the `account_databases`
//!   rows are gone (a cache rebuild fails typed), so the eviction is final.
//!   The pooled connections an un-evicted entry held during the drop are
//!   handled inside `delete_account` — `pg_terminate_backend` plus
//!   `DROP DATABASE … WITH (FORCE)`.
//!
//! # WebSocket severing
//!
//! Eviction drops the cache entry, and with it the entry's broadcast
//! `Sender`. When the last remaining clone goes — typically this DELETE
//! request's own `RequestEventChannel` extension, dropped with the response
//! — every `/ws` session's `Receiver` yields `RecvError::Closed`;
//! `ws::start_event_session`'s forwarding loop breaks on exactly that,
//! drops its `actix_ws::Session`, and the connection terminates (the
//! session channel closing ends the response's streaming body). No
//! cloud-side reaping of sessions is needed. Deletion deliberately bypasses
//! the live-receiver eviction pinning — pinning protects *idle* entries
//! from TTL eviction; it must never protect a deleted account's resources
//! ([`AccountCache::evict`] is unconditional by contract, and the e2e suite
//! pins the combination).
