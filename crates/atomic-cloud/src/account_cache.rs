//! Per-account tenant cache (plan: "Auth & tenant routing" → "AccountCache").
//!
//! Every active account holds open resources — a [`DatabaseManager`] whose
//! pool points at the account's tenant database, and a broadcast channel its
//! WebSocket clients subscribe to. [`AccountCache`] owns those resources:
//! the auth middleware resolves an account to a [`TenantHandle`] here, and
//! requests for accounts nobody has touched in a while release their pools
//! back to the cluster.
//!
//! # Eviction
//!
//! The sweep runs in two places. It runs **inline** while inserting a
//! freshly loaded entry (the only moment the cache grows), so steady-state
//! hits pay nothing. And because a stable working set produces no inserts —
//! idle entries would otherwise hold their pools forever — the `serve`
//! binary also runs [`AccountCache::sweep`] from a **periodic task**
//! (default every `idle_ttl / 4`; see `main.rs`). The cache itself owns no
//! task lifecycle; `sweep` is a plain method the composition schedules.
//!
//! Two rules, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Idle TTL** — entries untouched for longer than
//!    [`AccountCacheConfig::idle_ttl`] are dropped.
//! 2. **Hard cap** — if the cache is still at
//!    [`AccountCacheConfig::max_entries`], least-recently-touched entries
//!    are dropped until the new entry fits.
//!
//! Neither rule ever evicts an entry whose `event_tx` has live receivers
//! (decision 2026-06-09): a quiet-but-connected WebSocket client would
//! otherwise keep listening on a channel nothing publishes to. As a
//! consequence the hard cap is a target, not an invariant — if every entry
//! has a live subscriber the cache temporarily exceeds it rather than
//! orphaning a connection; growth stays bounded by the number of accounts
//! with open WebSockets.
//!
//! # Load coalescing
//!
//! Concurrent `get_or_load` calls for the same account must not build two
//! managers (each build opens a pool and replays the migration check). A
//! per-account async mutex serializes builders: the first caller takes the
//! account's build permit and loads; coalesced callers wait on the same
//! permit and find the finished entry when they acquire it. Failures are
//! not cached — each waiting caller retries the build itself.
//!
//! # Provider config (plan: "Plumbing — control plane → AtomicCore")
//!
//! The cache-miss build is where control-plane provider state reaches a
//! serving tenant: the account's active `provider_credentials` row is
//! loaded, decrypted through the [`KeyVault`], and turned into an explicit
//! [`ProviderConfig`] that the tenant manager is opened with — **always**
//! `Some`, never `None`. `None` would put atomic-core in settings-fallback
//! mode, letting the tenant database's own settings rows select providers;
//! the plan forbids that path in cloud. An account with no credentials row
//! gets a key-less config ([`keyless_provider_config`]) so provider calls
//! fail with a structured missing-key error rather than falling back.
//!
//! Live rotation ([`AccountCache::update_provider_config`]) swaps the config
//! on a cached entry **in place** — no eviction, so in-flight operations
//! finish on the config they started with while new operations pick up the
//! fresh one (plan: "Live rotation", steps 4-5).
//!
//! ## Generation-checked convergence
//!
//! The in-place swap only reaches the pod that handled the rotation, and it
//! can race a concurrent entry build (the build reads credentials, the
//! rotation lands, the swap misses, the build inserts the *old* config).
//! `accounts.provider_generation` bounds both: every provider mutation
//! bumps it transactionally ([`crate::provider_credentials`]), each cache
//! entry records the generation its config was built from — read in the
//! **same query** as the credentials, so the stamp is never newer than the
//! config — and CloudAuth's per-request account lookup (already a
//! per-request read; slice-1's no-auth-caching decision) carries the
//! current value into [`AccountCache::get_or_load_with_generation`]. A hit
//! whose entry lags the observed generation re-reads the control plane,
//! swaps the fresh config in place, and re-stamps the entry — under a
//! per-account refresh permit (the same keyed-lock idiom as the loading
//! map) so concurrent requests don't stampede the control plane. Any pod,
//! and any lost race, converges on the next authenticated request.
