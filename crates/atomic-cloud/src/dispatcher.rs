//! The per-pod dispatcher (plan: "Worker fairness & job queue").
//!
//! Each `atomic-cloud serve` process runs one dispatcher: a tick loop that
//! discovers pending tenant-ledger work and feeds it to the bounded
//! [`WorkerPools`] with per-tenant round-robin fairness. There is no leader
//! election — the durable ledgers' conditional claims (`FOR UPDATE SKIP
//! LOCKED` on `atom_pipeline_jobs`, conditional UPDATEs + a partial unique
//! index on `task_runs`) are the cross-pod mutual exclusion, so N pods
//! ticking over the same tenants merely race claims they can't double-win.
//! Jittered tick offsets keep a fleet from synchronizing its polls.
//!
//! # One tick
//!
//! 1. **Scan** ([`Dispatcher::tick`]): read `dispatch_hints` (fast path —
//!    only tenants something has marked); on the slow-scan interval, add
//!    *every* active account (the bound on hint loss; see
//!    [`crate::dispatch_hints`]). Tenants whose `provider_paused_until` is
//!    in the future are skipped wholesale — the provider circuit breaker
//!    ([`crate::backpressure`]) writes that column; their ledger work sits
//!    durably until the pause lapses or a provider mutation clears it.
//! 2. **Poll** each candidate tenant (the plan's N+1 poll): resolve its
//!    [`TenantHandle`] through the [`AccountCache`], fan over its knowledge
//!    bases, and translate ledger state into [`WorkItem`]s — claimable
//!    pipeline batches, due system tasks, due feeds, runnable wiki-regen
//!    retries, due reports. Nothing is claimed here; items are *intents*,
//!    and the executor's claim decides who actually runs.
//! 3. **Hint lifecycle**: a tenant with no items and empty ledgers gets its
//!    hint cleared via `clear_hint_if_older` (a mid-scan enqueue survives by
//!    stamp comparison); a tenant discovered with work by the slow path gets
//!    its hint (re)marked so the fast path watches it from now on.
//! 4. **Drain** ([`Dispatcher::drain`]): round-robin over a deque of
//!    per-tenant deques — pop a tenant, admit ONE job into its class pool,
//!    push the tenant back. Tenants over their per-tenant cap (or whose
//!    admissible classes are all exhausted) park for the rest of the tick.
//!    Admitted jobs run on spawned workers that **claim-then-execute**
//!    through the existing atomic-core machinery; pool permits release on
//!    completion.
//!
//! Un-drained items are simply dropped at the end of the tick — they are
//! re-derived from the ledgers next tick. The same property is the restart
//! story: in-memory queues evaporate with the process, durable leases
//! expire, and the next scan (here or on a peer pod) reclaims the work. The
//! dispatcher never extends or bypasses lease semantics.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! Workers route pipeline/ingestion events into the tenant's own event
//! channel (the [`AccountCache`] entry's `event_tx` — the channel the
//! tenant's WebSocket sessions subscribe to) through the same
//! `atomic-server::event_bridge` adapters the request path uses, so the
//! frontend experience is identical to inline execution.
//!
//! # Follow-on work
//!
//! Executed work often enqueues more ledger work (a feed poll creates atoms
//! whose pipeline jobs are now pending; a draft-pipeline pass enqueues
//! embedding jobs). Those writes don't pass through the data plane's
//! hint-marking middleware, so the worker re-marks the tenant's hint after
//! any execution that ran (or failed — failures leave backed-off retry rows
//! the fast path must keep watching).
//!
//! # Provider backpressure (plan: "Provider rate-limit handling")
//!
//! [`CoreExecutor`] classifies provider failures
//! ([`classify_provider_failure`]) out of both ledgers' failure surfaces
//! and applies the two layers:
//!
//! - **Layer 1, local backoff.** `task_runs` failures already get
//!   exponential `next_attempt_at` backoff from the ledger itself
//!   (`RunHandle::fail`); the dispatcher adds nothing there — its base unit
//!   (60s with jitter) dominates typical `Retry-After` hints, and the
//!   breaker pause is the provider-level hold. Pipeline-job failures are
//!   terminal in core (atom status `failed`, row cleared), so the executor
//!   **re-enqueues** rate-limit/credits-classified atoms with `not_before`
//!   honoring the provider's `Retry-After` hint (default
//!   [`RATE_LIMIT_REQUEUE_DELAY`]; credits failures wait out the pause
//!   horizon) — the job *sits in the ledger*, exactly the plan's
//!   blocked-not-failed semantics, and the claim predicate keeps it
//!   undispatchable until `not_before` passes.
//! - **Layer 2, the circuit breaker.** Each execution feeds
//!   [`ProviderBreaker`]: at most one rate-limit observation per executed
//!   item (one provider 429 can fan out across a batch's atoms — that's
//!   still one rate-limit response), an immediate credits pause on a 402,
//!   and a streak reset on a failure-free execution.
