//! The per-pod dispatcher (plan: "Worker fairness & job queue").
//!
//! Each `atomic-cloud serve` process runs one dispatcher: a tick loop that
//! discovers pending tenant-ledger work and feeds it to the bounded
//! [`WorkerPools`] with per-tenant round-robin fairness. There is no leader
//! election — the durable ledgers' conditional claims (`FOR UPDATE SKIP
//! LOCKED` on `atom_pipeline_jobs`, conditional UPDATEs + a partial unique
//! index on `task_runs`) are the cross-pod mutual exclusion, so N pods
//! ticking over the same tenants merely race claims they can't double-win.
//! Jittered tick offsets keep a fleet from synchronizing its polls.
//!
//! # One tick
//!
//! 1. **Scan** ([`Dispatcher::tick`]): read `dispatch_hints` (fast path —
//!    only tenants something has marked); on the slow-scan interval, add
//!    *every* active account (the bound on hint loss; see
//!    [`crate::dispatch_hints`]). Two per-tenant holds skip a candidate
//!    wholesale (work sits durably in its ledgers, hints untouched):
//!    tenants whose `provider_paused_until` is in the future — the provider
//!    circuit breaker ([`crate::backpressure`]) writes that column; the
//!    pause lapses or a provider mutation clears it — and tenants whose
//!    `last_migrated_version` lags the compiled tenant schema target. The
//!    latter is deploy gating's dispatcher arm
//!    ([`crate::fleet_migration`]): a mid-upgrade tenant's database is
//!    behind the schema this binary's work executors expect, exactly the
//!    state CloudAuth 503s on the request path, so background work waits
//!    until the fleet runner (or the reaper) stamps the tenant current.
//! 2. **Poll** each candidate tenant (the plan's N+1 poll): resolve its
//!    [`TenantHandle`] through the [`AccountCache`], fan over its knowledge
//!    bases, and translate ledger state into [`WorkItem`]s — claimable
//!    pipeline batches, due system tasks, due feeds, runnable wiki-regen
//!    retries, due reports. Nothing is claimed here; items are *intents*,
//!    and the executor's claim decides who actually runs.
//! 3. **Hint lifecycle**: a tenant with no items and empty ledgers gets its
//!    hint cleared via `clear_hint_if_older` (a mid-scan enqueue survives by
//!    stamp comparison); a tenant discovered with work by the slow path gets
//!    its hint (re)marked so the fast path watches it from now on.
//! 4. **Drain** ([`Dispatcher::drain`]): round-robin over a deque of
//!    per-tenant deques — pop a tenant, admit ONE job into its class pool,
//!    push the tenant back. Tenants over their per-tenant cap (or whose
//!    admissible classes are all exhausted) park for the rest of the tick.
//!    Admitted jobs run on spawned workers that **claim-then-execute**
//!    through the existing atomic-core machinery; pool permits release on
//!    completion.
//!
//! Un-drained items are simply dropped at the end of the tick — they are
//! re-derived from the ledgers next tick. The same property is the restart
//! story: in-memory queues evaporate with the process, durable leases
//! expire, and the next scan (here or on a peer pod) reclaims the work. The
//! dispatcher never extends or bypasses lease semantics.
//!
//! # Events — single-pod fidelity only
//!
//! Workers route pipeline/ingestion events into the tenant's own event
//! channel (the [`AccountCache`] entry's `event_tx` — the channel the
//! tenant's WebSocket sessions subscribe to) through the same
//! `atomic-server::event_bridge` adapters the request path uses.
//!
//! **This delivery is per-pod, in-memory.** The channel a worker publishes
//! into is the executing pod's cache entry; a WebSocket session subscribed
//! on a *different* pod — or on this pod after the entry was evicted and
//! rebuilt mid-execution — receives none of that execution's progress
//! events. Durable state is always correct (ledger rows, atom statuses,
//! and artifacts land in the tenant database regardless), and the frontend
//! self-heals on its next fetch, but live progress is only faithful when
//! the executing pod and the subscribed pod are the same — i.e.
//! single-pod deployments. A cross-pod event relay (e.g. Postgres
//! LISTEN/NOTIFY fan-out) is a planned follow-up for multi-pod
//! deployments; until then, expect missing WS progress events whenever a
//! peer pod wins the claim.
//!
//! # Follow-on work
//!
//! Executed work often enqueues more ledger work (a feed poll creates atoms
//! whose pipeline jobs are now pending; a draft-pipeline pass enqueues
//! embedding jobs). Those writes don't pass through the data plane's
//! hint-marking middleware, so the worker re-marks the tenant's hint after
//! any execution that ran (or failed — failures leave backed-off retry rows
//! the fast path must keep watching).
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here: streaming chat
//!
//! Every ledger-backed work-type flows through these pools; streaming chat
//! does not (plan: "Streaming chat (not in a pool)"). It is request-driven,
//! user-facing, and latency-critical — queueing a chat send behind another
//! tenant's wiki synthesis would be product-breaking, and there is no
//! durable row to re-claim on restart anyway. Its bound is a per-account
//! semaphore at the route instead: [`crate::chat_streams`], wired into the
//! data plane by `configure_cloud_app`.
//!
//! # Provider backpressure (plan: "Provider rate-limit handling")
//!
//! [`CoreExecutor`] classifies provider failures
//! ([`classify_provider_failure`]) out of both ledgers' failure surfaces
//! and applies the two layers:
//!
//! - **Layer 1, local backoff — jobs sit, they never fail.** For the
//!   `task_runs` ledger, the tenant cores run with the
//!   [`provider_failure_policy`](crate::backpressure::provider_failure_policy)
//!   installed (see [`crate::account_cache`]): a provider-classified
//!   failure *defers* the row (`RunHandle::defer_until` — lease released,
//!   `next_attempt_at` set to the provider's `Retry-After` clamped to
//!   [`DispatcherConfig::retry_after_cap`], or the pause-recheck horizon
//!   for credits/auth) **without consuming retry budget**, so a month of
//!   credit exhaustion can't burn `max_attempts` and terminally abandon
//!   wiki regeneration. Logic failures keep the ledger's own exponential
//!   backoff and attempt accounting. Pipeline-job failures are terminal in
//!   core (atom status `failed`, row cleared), so the executor
//!   **re-enqueues** provider-classified atoms with `not_before` honoring
//!   the same horizons (default [`RATE_LIMIT_REQUEUE_DELAY`]) — the job
//!   *sits in the ledger* and the claim predicate keeps it undispatchable
//!   until `not_before` passes. A provider mutation (rotation, activation,
//!   model change) re-arms both ledgers' provider-held horizons to "now"
//!   (see [`crate::tenant_plane`]), so the user's recovery action takes
//!   effect on the next tick instead of waiting out stale backoff.
//! - **Layer 2, the circuit breaker.** **Only provider-touching executions
//!   feed [`ProviderBreaker`]** ([`WorkItem::touches_provider`]):
//!   embedding batches and llm work call the provider; maintenance tasks
//!   and (non-inline) feed polls do not, and their outcomes are neutral
//!   both ways — a draft-pipeline success says nothing about the
//!   provider's health and must not reset the streak or clear the
//!   detection window. Per provider-class execution: at most one
//!   rate-limit observation (one provider 429 can fan out across a batch's
//!   atoms — that's still one rate-limit response), an immediate credits
//!   pause on a 402, an immediate provider-kind pause on a 401/403
//!   credential rejection, and a streak reset on a failure-free
//!   provider-class execution.
