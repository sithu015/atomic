//! The nightly backup pass, the final dump, and backup bookkeeping (plan:
//! "Backups & disaster recovery" → "v1: nightly logical dumps").
//!
//! This module is the orchestration layer over the two seams that do the
//! actual work — [`crate::backup`] (the `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` runner) and
//! [`crate::backup_store`] (where the bytes land). It owns:
//!
//! - The deterministic object keys (`backups/<date>/acct_<uuid>.dump`,
//!   `backups/<date>/control.dump`, `backups/final/<uuid>-<ts>.dump`).
//! - The typed control-plane queries that record per-tenant backup status
//!   and the `backup_runs` ledger.
//! - [`run_backup_pass`] — the nightly fleet pass, mirroring the reaper's
//!   shape: every tenant is dumped under its own per-account advisory lock so
//!   two pods never dump the same tenant at once, the control plane is dumped
//!   once per pass, and the whole thing is summarized in an observable
//!   [`BackupSummary`] and recorded as one `backup_runs` row.
//! - [`final_dump_before_delete`] — the fail-closed dump taken **before**
//!   `DROP DATABASE` in the active-account deletion path (the operator's only
//!   undo under hard-delete v1).
//! - [`stale_tenant_backups`] — the staleness monitor's query ("alert when
//!   any tenant's last successful backup is >36h old").
//!
//! Retention (14 daily + 8 weekly; 30-day finals) is **bucket lifecycle
//! policy, not code** (plan): nothing here ever deletes a backup.
