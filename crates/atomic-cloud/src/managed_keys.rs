//! Managed provider-key lifecycle (plan: "Provider management" → "Managed
//! key lifecycle"; signup step 9; deletion step 3; decision 2026-06-09).
//!
//! Every account gets a platform-provisioned OpenRouter runtime key at
//! signup, minted via the provisioning API ([`crate::provisioning_api`])
//! with the plan's monthly credit allowance and native monthly reset,
//! encrypted via the [`KeyVault`], and stored as the account's
//! `(openrouter, managed)` credentials row. [`ManagedKeys`] is the handle
//! the provisioning/deletion/reaper paths thread through; its `Disabled`
//! mode (the dev default when no provisioning key is configured) skips the
//! lifecycle entirely — accounts provision with no credentials row and run
//! in the keyless "missing key" state.
//!
//! # The orphan window, and why the row insert is immediate
//!
//! `create_key` is the one non-idempotent provisioning step: every call
//! mints a new key billed against the master account. The credentials row
//! is what makes the key findable by every later step (resume, rotation,
//! deletion, rollback), so it is inserted **immediately** after the create
//! returns — the milliseconds between the provider's create and our insert
//! are the only window in which a process crash strands a key nothing in
//! the control plane references. Accepted residue, by design: the
//! operational fallback is the master OpenRouter account's dashboard, which
//! lists every runtime key it has minted (see the custody runbook in
//! [`crate::provisioning_api`]). An insert *failure* (as opposed to a
//! crash) closes its own window: the just-created key is deleted
//! best-effort before the error propagates.
//!
//! # Best-effort deletion, everywhere
//!
//! Every key-deleting path — account deletion step 3, the stuck-provision
//! rollback, the 23503 orphan cleanup, interrupted-deletion recovery — is
//! **best-effort with loud logging**: a provider outage must never wedge an
//! account deletion or a rollback (plan: deletion is hard-delete v1; a
//! deletion blocked on a third party is a worse failure than a leaked
//! $0.50-capped key). The trade-off is real residue: once the credentials
//! row is gone (the accounts-row CASCADE sweeps it), nothing in the control
//! plane can re-derive the external key id, so the reaper cannot retry a
//! failed delete. The loud `tracing::error!` plus the master-account
//! listing is the recovery path.
