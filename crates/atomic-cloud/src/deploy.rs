//! Deploy gating: readiness, the failure-rate policy, and `deploy_runs`
//! history (plan: "Provisioning lifecycle" → "Schema migration on deploy",
//! steps 4-5 + the policy table + "Rollback").
//!
//! The new binary boots in **migrating mode**: liveness (`/health`) is up
//! from the first request, but the public `/ready` endpoint answers 503
//! until the boot fleet migration ([`crate::fleet_migration`]) completes
//! *and* the failure-rate policy admits. One mechanism, one policy, in one
//! place:
//!
//! | Failure rate            | [`DeployStatus`]     | Readiness |
//! |-------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
//! | `x < ready threshold` (1%, incl. 0) | `Ready`  | ready — sub-threshold failures are stragglers: CloudAuth 503s them per request, the reaper retries them |
//! | `ready ≤ x < review` (10%) | `AwaitingReview`  | not ready until an operator runs `deploy advance` |
//! | `x ≥ review`            | `RollbackRequired`   | never ready on this binary |
//! | run > wall-clock limit  | `MigrationTimeout`   | not ready; restart re-runs the fleet (already-migrated tenants no-op) |
//!
//! Every boot attempt persists one `deploy_runs` row (migration 009):
//! started/finished timestamps, the run's counts, and the policy verdict —
//! operator history (`atomic-cloud deploy status`) plus the durable home of
//! the awaiting-review acknowledgment.
//!
//! # `deploy advance` (the awaiting-review override)
//!
//! `awaiting_review` means the failure rate is suspicious but plausibly
//! environmental (a subset of tenant databases unreachable during the
//! deploy). The operator inspects `deploy status`, and either redeploys or
//! runs `deploy advance` — which flips every `awaiting_review` run *at the
//! latest target version* to `advanced` **in the control plane**, so every
//! pod holding on that review (each pod boots its own run row) observes the
//! acknowledgment on its next readiness probe and flips ready. The
//! acknowledgment is per-boot-generation by construction: a future deploy
//! inserts fresh rows that start unacknowledged.
//!
//! **`rollback_required` has no override, deliberately.** A ≥10% failure
//! rate is not straggler noise — the migration itself is broken, and every
//! tenant it *did* convert is only safe because migrations are
//! additive-only. Admitting traffic would serve the broken majority a 503
//! wall while the operator "reviews" a migration that needs code changes.
//! The remedy is structural and already safe: redeploy the old binary (it
//! reads the additive schema fine) and fix the migration. An override flag
//! here would just be a footgun pointed at the largest possible blast
//! radius.
//!
//! **Small fleets hit the rollback band on a single tenant — by design.**
//! One permanently broken tenant in a 2-tenant fleet is a 50% failure rate
//! and `rollback_required` with no override; the percentage policy has no
//! special case for small denominators, deliberately — at that scale the
//! operator can and should look at the actual tenant rather than trust a
//! rate. The operator path: inspect `deploy status` for the stored error,
//! fix the broken tenant (restore/repair its database) or delete the
//! account, then redeploy — the fresh gate run finds the fleet healthy.
//! Tuning `--deploy-review-failure-rate` for a small fleet is the knob if
//! the policy itself is wrong for the deployment.
//!
//! # What readiness does NOT gate
//!
//! Readiness is the load balancer's signal, not a request gate: a pod that
//! is "not ready" still serves traffic that reaches it (existing
//! connections, direct pod access). Per-request safety is CloudAuth's
//! straggler gate — a behind-schema tenant 503s regardless of pod
//! readiness. The two layers are complementary, not redundant.
