# Running Atomic Cloud locally (headless box, SSH over Tailscale)

A practical guide to standing up the whole cloud stack — account-plane frontend
+ APIs + a tenant — on a **headless dev box** you reach over **Tailscale via
SSH**, so you can click through signup, the dashboard, billing, and MCP in a
real browser.

The cloud frontend routes by `Host` (`app.<base>` = signup/login,
`<slug>.<base>` = the tenant dashboard), so the one wrinkle a headless setup
adds is getting those hostnames to resolve to the box and getting the session
cookie to work over plain HTTP. Both are handled below.

---

## One command

```bash
scripts/cloud-dev.sh      # on the box: Postgres (Docker) + both frontends built + cloud server (host)
```

That brings up the whole stack — Postgres in Docker, the account-plane
frontend **and** the product knowledge-base app built and served by the cloud
server on one origin (so "Open knowledge base" works), all the dev flags wired
in, a stable dev master key persisted across restarts. `SKIP_BUILD=1` skips the
frontend builds for a fast restart; `REBUILD=1` forces them; `BIND=0.0.0.0`
exposes it directly over Tailscale instead of through an SSH tunnel.

You still need to (a) resolve `*.cloudtest.local` to the box — see "Resolving
tenant subdomains" below (dnsmasq is the one-time fix) — and (b) reach the port
(SSH tunnel or `BIND=0.0.0.0`). Then open `http://app.cloudtest.local:8080/`.

The rest of this doc is the manual breakdown of what that script does, plus the
DNS/cookie details worth understanding.

## TL;DR (manual)

On the **box** (over SSH):

```bash
cd ~/git/atomic
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d                 # Postgres on :5433

npm --prefix crates/atomic-cloud/frontend ci
npm --prefix crates/atomic-cloud/frontend run build             # account frontend → frontend/dist
npm ci && npm run build:web                                     # product app → dist-web

export ATOMIC_CLOUD_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
CTL=postgres://atomic:atomic_test@localhost:5433/atomic_cloud_dev   # NB: a DEV control DB, not the test one
CLUSTER=postgres://atomic:atomic_test@localhost:5433/atomic_test

cargo run -p atomic-cloud -- --control-url "$CTL" migrate
cargo run -p atomic-cloud -- --control-url "$CTL" serve \
  --cluster-url "$CLUSTER" \
  --base-domain cloudtest.local \
  --app-public-url http://app.cloudtest.local:8080 \
  --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 \
  --email-mode log \
  --dangerously-insecure-cookies \
  --product-dir dist-web         # serve the product app at the tenant root (the KB link)
```

On your **laptop**:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 <box>            # tunnel the cloud port over your Tailscale SSH
# add to /etc/hosts (on the laptop):
#   127.0.0.1  app.cloudtest.local cloudtest.local alpha.cloudtest.local
```

Then browse `http://app.cloudtest.local:8080/`.

---

## Why those flags

The two headless-specific flags matter; the rest are ordinary dev settings.

- **`--dangerously-insecure-cookies`** — the session cookie is normally
  `Secure` (HTTPS-only). Browsers only exempt `localhost`/`*.localhost` from
  that rule, so over plain HTTP on any *other* host (a Tailscale IP, a
  MagicDNS name, or `app.cloudtest.local`) the browser **silently drops the
  cookie** and the dashboard can never log you in. This flag drops `Secure`
  for dev. **Never use it in production** — the server logs a loud warning at
  boot when it's set. (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and the base-domain scope
  stay on.)
- **`--app-public-url http://app.cloudtest.local:8080`** — the origin used for
  emailed magic links and for the post-login redirect to your tenant
  subdomain. It carries the scheme **and port**, so links land on
  `http://...:8080` instead of a default-port HTTPS URL you can't reach.
- **`--base-domain cloudtest.local`** — any name works as long as it matches
  your `/etc/hosts` entries; `cloudtest.local` is the convention used in the
  e2e tests.
- **`--email-mode log`** — magic links are written to the server log instead
  of emailed. You copy the link from the log (see below).

## Access: SSH tunnel (recommended) vs direct Tailscale

**SSH tunnel (above)** is the simplest and keeps the box's port closed to the
tailnet. Bind `127.0.0.1`, `ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 <box>`, and point the
laptop's `/etc/hosts` at `127.0.0.1`. The browser hits `…:8080` → tunnel → box.

**Direct over Tailscale** (e.g. to test from a phone on the tailnet): bind the
Tailscale interface and point `/etc/hosts` at the box's Tailscale IP instead:

```bash
# on the box:
cargo run -p atomic-cloud -- ... --bind 0.0.0.0 --app-public-url http://app.cloudtest.local:8080 ...
# on each client, /etc/hosts:
#   100.x.y.z  app.cloudtest.local cloudtest.local alpha.cloudtest.local   (the box's Tailscale IP)
```

Either way the client `/etc/hosts` is what makes the `Host`-based subdomain
routing resolve.

## Resolving tenant subdomains (the thing that bites)

`/etc/hosts` has **no wildcards**. Each line maps one exact name, so the
entries above (`app.cloudtest.local`, `alpha.cloudtest.local`) only cover those
names. After signup the server redirects to **`<your-slug>.cloudtest.local`** —
if that slug isn't in `/etc/hosts`, the browser fails with **"the server IP
address could not be found"** (a DNS miss, not a connection error). The quick
fix is to add the exact slug:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1  myslug.cloudtest.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts   # your actual slug
#   (use the box's Tailscale IP instead of 127.0.0.1 if you're hitting it directly, not via the tunnel)
```

To stop editing `/etc/hosts` for every account, give yourself **wildcard DNS
for `*.cloudtest.local`** with dnsmasq (one-time setup, macOS):

```bash
brew install dnsmasq
echo 'address=/cloudtest.local/127.0.0.1' >> "$(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf"
sudo brew services start dnsmasq
# tell macOS to resolve *.cloudtest.local via the local dnsmasq:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver
echo 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' | sudo tee /etc/resolver/cloudtest.local
# verify:
scutil --dns | grep -A1 cloudtest.local        # should list 127.0.0.1
dscacheutil -q host -a name anything.cloudtest.local   # should resolve to 127.0.0.1
```

Now every `*.cloudtest.local` resolves to loopback (point it at the box's
Tailscale IP instead of `127.0.0.1` for the direct-Tailscale mode), no per-slug
edits, and the cross-subdomain session cookie keeps working because
`cloudtest.local` is a normal multi-label domain.

**Zero-install alternative:** serve with `--base-domain 127.0.0.1.sslip.io
--app-public-url http://app.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:8080`. [sslip.io](https://sslip.io)
resolves `<anything>.127.0.0.1.sslip.io` → `127.0.0.1` (and
`<anything>.<dashed-ip>.sslip.io` → that IP, e.g. your Tailscale address) over
public DNS — no `/etc/hosts`, no dnsmasq. Uglier URLs and needs internet, but
nothing to configure.

## Create an account and log in

In a second shell **on the box** (same `CTL`/`CLUSTER` env):

```bash
cargo run -p atomic-cloud -- --control-url "$CTL" account create \
  --cluster-url "$CLUSTER" --email you@example.com --subdomain alpha
```

That provisions the `alpha` tenant and prints a one-time account token (handy
for `curl`). For the **browser** dashboard you need a session cookie, which you
get from the magic-link flow:

1. Browse `http://app.cloudtest.local:8080/login`, enter the account email.
2. The server log prints a line with a `…/login/complete?token=aml_…` URL.
   Open that URL in the browser — it sets the session cookie and redirects you
   to `http://alpha.cloudtest.local:8080/`.
3. Visit `http://alpha.cloudtest.local:8080/account` — the dashboard
   (overview, provider, billing, MCP, danger zone).

> New signups work the same way: `/signup` → grab the `…/signup/complete?token=…`
> link from the log → it provisions a fresh tenant and logs you in.

## What to click through

- **`app.cloudtest.local:8080/`** — landing, `/signup` (live `<slug>.<base>`
  preview, validation + rate-limit handling), `/login` (existence-neutral).
- **`alpha.cloudtest.local:8080/account`** — Overview (plan/usage/banners),
  Provider/BYOK settings, Billing (the "Manage billing" button needs Stripe
  keys; without them it shows the configured-off state), MCP setup, and the
  typed-confirmation delete flow.
- **`alpha.cloudtest.local:8080/`** — with `--product-dir` set, the **product
  knowledge-base app** (the dark atoms/canvas UI) served at the tenant root;
  the dashboard's "Open knowledge base" link lands here. Without it, the tenant
  root falls back to the dashboard. (In production a reverse proxy serves the
  product app here — `--product-dir` reproduces that on one origin for dev.)

## AI providers: managed keys vs BYOK

By default (`--provisioning-mode disabled`) new tenants are **keyless** — no AI
provider — so the product app's onboarding shows the AI-provider step. Two ways
to give a tenant working AI:

**BYOK (no OpenRouter account needed).** On the dashboard's **Provider** page,
paste an OpenRouter or OpenAI-compatible key (or point an `openai_compat` base
URL at any local OpenAI-compatible server). Validated before storage; takes
effect live.

**Managed keys (real OpenRouter).** The cloud mints a per-tenant OpenRouter
runtime key at signup. It's real spend, so it needs real credentials:

1. An OpenRouter account with credit, and a **Provisioning API key** (a distinct
   key type — OpenRouter dashboard → Settings → Provisioning API Keys — that can
   *mint* runtime keys; not a normal API key).
2. Turn it on (one env var; `cloud-dev.sh` flips `--provisioning-mode openrouter`
   when it's set):
   ```bash
   export ATOMIC_CLOUD_OPENROUTER_PROVISIONING_KEY=<provisioning-key>
   REBUILD=1 scripts/cloud-dev.sh          # log shows "managed provisioning ON"
   ```
3. **Sign up a NEW account through the web flow** (`app.<base>/signup`). Two
   constraints by design: the CLI `account create` is **keyless** (operator
   tooling never holds the provisioning key), so it won't mint one; and existing
   keyless tenants aren't upgraded retroactively. Signup step 9 mints the key
   (default **50¢/mo** allowance, OpenRouter-enforced; `--managed-key-allowance-cents`
   to change), encrypts it, stores it. Create an atom → it embeds/tags with no
   BYOK setup; the Provider page shows `managed` + usage. Managed mode pins the
   embedding model fleet-wide and curates the LLM list (expected).
4. **Clean up.** Each test signup mints a real key. Deleting the account
   (dashboard danger zone) deletes its key via the provisioning API; revoke any
   stragglers in the OpenRouter provisioning dashboard. Spend is capped per key
   at the allowance.

> The mint→encrypt→store→delete *lifecycle* is covered by automated tests with a
> recording provisioning double; the only thing the manual test adds is
> confirming real inference works through a managed key (which needs the real
> OpenRouter credentials above — a fake minted key can't call the model).

## Fast visual iteration (Vite HMR)

For tight styling loops, run the Vite dev server (hot reload) instead of
rebuilding:

```bash
# on the box:  npm --prefix crates/atomic-cloud/frontend run dev   (Vite on :5173, proxies /api to :8080)
# on the laptop:  ssh -L 5173:127.0.0.1:5173 -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 <box>
```

Keep the cloud server (`serve`) running for the APIs. HMR is great for
component/styling tweaks; the full `Host`-based routing + cookie auth is most
faithful through the built-and-served path above, so do a final pass there.

## Two things that will bite you

1. **The reaper vs. the test suite, on a shared cluster.** The server's
   orphan-reclaim drops `acct_*` tenant databases it doesn't recognize — which,
   on the cluster the test suite shares, includes the suite's. `cloud-dev.sh`
   handles this by passing **`--reaper-interval-secs 0`** (disables the reaper;
   a dev box doesn't need it), so dev and `cargo test` can run against the same
   cluster without the reaper eating test DBs. If you run `serve` by hand against
   the test cluster, pass `--reaper-interval-secs 0` too (or stop it before
   `cargo test`). Either way, use a **separate dev control DB**
   (`atomic_cloud_dev`).
2. **`--dangerously-insecure-cookies` is dev-only.** It exists solely so the
   session cookie survives plain HTTP on a non-`localhost` host. Production
   runs over HTTPS without it.

## Teardown

```bash
# stop the dev server (Ctrl-C), then optionally drop the dev databases:
PGPASSWORD=atomic_test psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U atomic -d atomic_test \
  -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS atomic_cloud_dev WITH (FORCE);"
# tenant DBs (acct_*) created by your dev account can be dropped the same way,
# or via:  atomic-cloud --control-url "$CTL" account delete --subdomain alpha
```
