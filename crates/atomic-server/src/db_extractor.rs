//! Database resolution extractor for actix-web.
//!
//! `Db` is a `FromRequest` extractor that resolves the correct `AtomicCore`
//! from the request (via `X-Atomic-Database` header, `?db=` param, or active
//! db). By default it resolves against the [`DatabaseManager`] in
//! [`AppState`]; callers composing atomic-server's routes under their own
//! middleware can override that per request via [`RequestDatabaseManager`].

/// Per-request override for which [`DatabaseManager`] the [`Db`] extractor

/// Callers composing atomic-server's routes under their own middleware can
/// insert this into a request's extensions to direct that request at a
/// manager other than the one in [`AppState`]. The extension carries the
/// *manager* rather than a pre-resolved [`AtomicCore`] so the per-request
/// database selection rules (`X-Atomic-Database` header, `?db=` query
/// parameter, active-database fallback) stay defined in exactly one place —
/// [`resolve_core`] — regardless of where the manager came from.
///
/// When absent (the standalone server installs no middleware that sets it),
/// the extractor falls back to [`AppState`]'s manager, so compositions that
/// don't need the override pay no per-request cost.
